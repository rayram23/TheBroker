# TheBroker - A Work In Progress
An easier way to work with RabbitMq. Sending a receiving messages to and from RabbitMq should be that simple. However the RabbitMq client requires much more boiler plate code to be written and resources to manage (connections, channels, threads). TheBroker aims to simplify the process by providing a simplified API to expose just those use cases. Those who require much more control over resource management should look elsewhere or submit a merge request. As with anything that simplifies a robust API some assumptions are made. 

This project is a work in progress. A production ready implementation is already in use but needs some cleaning up before mass consumption. This is my effort to do so.....
